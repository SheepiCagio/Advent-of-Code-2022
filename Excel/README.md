Advent of Code done in Excel for better or worse. Only using core excel, so no vba involved. 
I didn't prettify the formulas so if you don't understand feel free to reach out and I will do my best to explain the logic. 

Day 11 only contains part 1. As Excel runs out of memory for part 2 :-(

Day 21 has the .xlsm extension, however there is no vba involved. Some of the new and more advanced excel formulas require the .xlsm extention. In this case I used the evaluate formula to dynamically create and evaluat a formula from the input
